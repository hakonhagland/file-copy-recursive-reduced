README for Perl extension File-Copy-Recursive-Reduced
  File-Copy-Recursive-Reduced is a Perl library which provides
  subroutines exported on request which are intended to serve as
  drop-in replacements for certain subroutines found in CPAN
  distribution File-Copy-Recursive
  <http://search.cpan.org/~dmuey/File-Copy-Recursive-0.40/> (FCR).

 What Problem Does This Library Address?
  Because of certain problems in FCR, it is currently (April 2018)
  failing to install on several important operating systems
  including FreeBSD and Windows. As a consequence, other CPAN
  distributions which have a direct or indirect dependency on
  File-Copy-Recursive (*e.g.*, CPAN-Reporter, DateTime,
  Dist-Zilla) are failing to install on those platforms as well.

  Such failures are "silent" in the sense that CPANtesters
  installations generate no report authors when a distribution's
  upstream dependencies fail to install. No report to the
  CPANtesters database means no email notification to CPAN
  authors. So many authors may be unaware that their distributions
  are currently failing to install on important platforms.

  A patch has been submitted to address the problems in FCR.
  However, until it is applied and a new CPAN release made,
  consumers of FCR should consider using the replacement functions
  exported by File-Copy-Recursive-Reduced.

 Install
  This library can be installed in the customary way, *i.e.,* by a
  CPAN installer program such as cpan or cpanm or by satisfying
  its prerequisites (Capture::Tiny and Path::Tiny, for the test
  suite only) and then calling:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  For further information, after installation call "perldoc
  File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced".
